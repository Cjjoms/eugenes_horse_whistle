This mod is sort of a remastered verison of data pack Horse Whistle. We made it so when you press H to whistle,
your saddled friend will neigh, hightline itself of seconds, find its way to come along(or teleport closer first if necessary), 
and follow you for a while.
One more thing! We added a new feature: Spur! 
When you are riding, press H to spur your horse on. 
It will get a little injured, but it will speed up for a while! Even more, 
there are two levels of spur-speed, meaning that you can spur it twice to make it run even faster.

# Eugene's Whistle & Spur
This is originally for modpack [AnimateCraft: Lankeren](https://modrinth.com/modpack/animatecraft-lankeren). If you like this content, play it in the modpack to gain the best experience!


## Whistle
This mod is sort of a remastered verison of data pack [Horse Whistle](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/horse-whistle-call-your-horse-to-come-to-you-just-like-that-in-red-dead-redemption-2/). We made it so when you press H to whistle,
your saddled friend will neigh, hightline itself of seconds, find its way to come along(or teleport closer first if necessary), 
and follow you for a while.

## Spur
#### One more thing! We added a new feature: Spur! 
When you are riding, press H to spur your horse on. 
It will get a little injured, but it will speed up for a while! Even more, 
there are two levels of spur-speed, meaning that you can spur it twice to make it run even faster.
